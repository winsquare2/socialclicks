Social Clicks must be a new name to you, that’s because it is! (EST 2018).<br><br> 
Founder and Director of Social Clicks, Silas and Darryl started their journey by first stepping foot into the highly competitive and adrenaline running world of marketing when they got themselves hired at an international Social Media Marketing Agency. Working there, they learned many things, but felt that many things should and could be improved on internally and externally. Allocation of work can be better organised, management of resources had room for improvement and ultimately productivity needed to increase. More importantly, they believe that there are many things that had to be performed better in order for clients to fully benefit. Voicing up to their superiors was to no avail, hence they knew that it was time to leave the company.<br><br>
Silas and Darryl decided to continue doing marketing for businesses on a freelance basis as it has always been their passion. They then had the opportunity of learning new skills and diversifying their services. They had no intention of building a business so soon, but it was the confidence and encouragement from the people they work with that instilled the idea into their heads. They believe strongly in working professionally and constantly think of ways to further add value to their clients. Quality service and customer satisfaction are the foundation to their growth.<br><br>
Soon enough, Founder, Silas decided to found Social Clicks and invited Director, Darryl to take upon this journey with him. They recognise their talent and potential and recruited more bright and ambitious members to chase this dream with them. With a team full of leaders determined to advance and take on the corporate world, Social Clicks’ team will embark on a challenging but exciting journey that is far from its end.<br><br>
Fast forward a few months after, things consistently kept falling into place for Social Clicks. The team grew in maturity, size and bond. Every member treated each other like family and worked together to get things accomplished. With so much politics going on in so many corporations and organisations, the Social Clicks’ team decided that they have no interest in stepping above one another but instead boost each other to achieve greater things. Silas and Darryl were always fixated that all members have to love and enjoy their job, and being part of Social Clicks as a whole. In terms of business, sales surpassed expected targets and the team got busier and busier for good reasons. They soon decided to slow down in taking in clients as they wanted to focus on the existing clients and maintain quality execution in the work that they do.
All in all, Social Clicks is a team comprising of highly passionate, competitive and young individuals that are not afraid of what they are stepping into. They believe that their biggest competitors are themselves and they are willing to move mountains to achieve their goals.</p><br><br>
